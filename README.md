> Scenario 1 of Gloomhaven with starting classes of different editions

## Introduction

*Gloomhaven Secretariat* is a **companion app** for Gloomhaven-based board games. The app supports all official editions, namely **Gloomhaven**, **Frosthaven**, **Jaws of the Lion** and **Forgotten Circles**, the community editions **The Crimson Scales** and **Trail of Ashes** as well as **Solo** scenarios and custom content.

*GHS* is a complete replacement for the abandoned [Gloomhaven Helper](http://esotericsoftware.com/gloomhaven-helper) app (by [Esoteric Software®](http://esotericsoftware.com)), enhanced with more tracking and automation features. As a single-screen web application, *GHS* helps manage scenario play by tracking character and monster turns, automatically setting up monsters separately for each room or section, assisting with scenario-specific rules, attack modifiers, loot deck, and much more. *GHS* also tracks your progress on the Character, Party and Campaign sheets, allowing you to buy and equip items, loot treasures, apply all scenario rewards, register scenario unlocks and manage your outpost. For a more detailed feature list, including a comparison of some popular applications, see [Comparison of Companion Apps](./resources/app-comparison.md).

Multiple clients are supported by a server component [Gloomhaven Secretariat Server](https://github.com/Lurkars/ghs-server) with a public instance available at `gloomhaven-secretariat.de`.

Since *GHS* is a web application, no installation is required and it runs in any modern browser, even on mobile devices, but it can also be [installed](#install) for offline use.

*Gloomhaven Secretariat* is open-source software built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and is open for the community to actively [contribute](#contributing) ideas, suggestions and of course feedback and bug fixes.

A basic user guide is available [online](https://help.gloomhaven-secretariat.de).

#### Build and run with Docker

[![Publish Docker Image](https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretariat/actions/workflows/publish-docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretariat/actions/workflows/publish-docker-image.yml)

If you want to use docker to run on port 80, run the following

```shell
docker pull gloomhavensecretariat/ghs
docker run --rm -p 80:80 --name ghs gloomhavensecretariat/ghs
```

For use with docker compose, just run `docker compose up -d`.

## Building from source

If you want to create your own custom build (e.g. for [self-hosting](#Selfhosting)), prepare a [development setup](#development). Then run `npm run build` ([available options](https://angular.io/cli/build#options)) and access the build at `./dist/gloomhavensecretariat`.

## Development

Prerequisite:

- Current [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm version

Check out the source with `git clone https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretariat.git`.

Install the dependencies with `npm install`.

Then run `npm run start` to create a development server at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

To develop with docker, install docker compose and run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d`.

## Contributing

Feel free to file a [new issue](https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretariat/issues/new/choose) for bugs, features, and improvements, or start a new [new discussion](https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretariat/discussions/new/choose) for help or feedback.

All game data is located in the [data](./data/) folder with subfolders for each release. A third-party review of all data would be great. As all files are JSON data, they should easily be human-readable. Each character, monster, and monster deck has its own file, so it should be easy to check.
Each edition folder will be concatenated into a single edition data file on build.

Pull requests are also welcome!

> Please note: all files in the data subfolder will be automatically formatted and added to each commit. If you have made local changes to these files and do NOT want to commit those changes, please use the `--no-verify` parameter for your `git commit` and `git push` commands.

Thanks to everyone who has already [contributed](https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretariat/graphs/contributors), you're awesome!

## Archive

All older versions are also available on `gloomhaven-secretariat.de`, for example the first version `v0.0.1` is available at [v0-0-1.gloomhaven-secretariat.de](https://v0-0-1.gloomhaven-secretariat.de). All available tags are listed under [Releases](https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretariat/releases), just replace all `.` with `-` for a proper url. This is meant as a showcase for the evolution of GHS, but also as a fallback, if a release breaks something important, you can always fall back to a previous version.

## Personal disclaimer

This is a hobby project I do in my spare time. The software fills a practical need due to the demise of the original Gloomhaven Helper application, so I am following the **Quick'n'Dirty** approach to get things done quickly. This of course leads to a lack of quality and testing and the code base is definitely not in line with my professional work.

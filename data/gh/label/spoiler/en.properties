"What did you say about my horns?" the Inox shouts.<br><br>The man stands up and brushes shards of glass from his tunic. "I said the sight of them makes me want to vomit!"<br><br>The Inox roars and charges headlong into the man, crashing through more tables in the process. At this, the entire tavern erupts into violence. After all, when a man is deep into his drink, the last thing you want to do is knock that drink over.
events.gh.city.1.options.1.choice=Join the fray! These insults will not go unanswered!
events.gh.city.1.options.1.outcome=Nothing like busting some drunken skulls to lift one's spirits. It turns out to be a great way to unwind. Unfortunately, the proprietor of the Sleeping Lion doesn't exactly see it that way, and he sullenly asks for compensation for the damage you caused.
events.gh.city.1.options.2.choice=Do your best to stop the fighting. This is a respectable establishment.
events.gh.city.1.options.2.outcome=After restraining the enraged Inox and offering to replace the drinks of a few of the more belligerent patrons, you calm the place down a bit.

I have something you might be interested in."<br><br>The Vermling holds out a piece of metal covered in sludge. "Found this in the sewer. Writing on it I don't understand, but I know it's valuable. You can have it for ten gold!"
events.gh.city.2.options.1.choice=Pay for the thing. You never know.
events.gh.city.2.options.1.effects.1.1=You hand over the gold and take hold of the piece of garbage. Amidst troubling brown smears you see a lot of meaningless scratches likely made by rats and bugs. Oh well. Sometimes the long shot doesn't pay off.

events.gh.city.2.options.2.choice=Refuse to pay. Never trust a Vermling.

events.gh.city.4.options.2.outcome=You approach the foreboding house full of heroic bravado.

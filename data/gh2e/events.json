The councilman gives a sigh before continuing.<br><br>\"I have an emissary here from the Eastern Continent. Their delegation has been staying under my roof, in my care. This afternoon was supposed to be the presentation of a gift of rare star iron.\" He wrings his hands as another loud crash can be heard from the room.<br><br>\"Perhaps you are familiar with Gloomhaven's very own Harrower vigilante, the Green Carapace?\" You've heard the name. \"A half hour ago, they broke into my parlor and stole the chest of star iron! And in the process, they attacked the esteemed delegate, reducing them to...\" The councilman spots something crawling out from under the door and instinctively goes to smash it, stopping himself at the last moment. He ushers it carefully back inside.<br><br>\"Well, the vigilante dissolved the delegate into a sea of bugs.\"<br><br>\"Perhaps that's a bit dramatic. The esteemed delegate Buzar is a Harrower, so they're normally made of bugs. They're just normally bugs that can... talk.\" Councilman Greymare cracks the door open to give you a look inside at the horrifying sight: thousands of bugs crawl across every visible surface. A fainting couch features most of a Harrower, a sentient hive-creature made of insects, but it's clear they're not in control of most of their body. Buzzing through the air and draped all over the cushions is a black carpet of undulating legs and mandibles. An Orchid woman in the traditional garb of the Eastern Continent rushes about, trying to corral the insects.<br><br>He closes the door, visibly disturbed by the sight. \"Where is my valet? We need more containers.\" He tugs on a nearby closet door but is thwarted by the lock. \"Blast it. Where is Apollon!?\" He starts down the hall when the closet door clicks open from the inside, and a slim, olive-skinned man stumbles out and falls to the ground.<br><br>\"Ugh... the Green... Carapace, they attacked me. I tried to stop them...\" Apollon gives a ragged cough, and from the way his wrist is hanging, it looks broken.<br><br>The councilman looks mortified. \"Not you too! The chest of star iron is set to be presented in two hours' time—that gift will secure our trade route for the next decade! I've got the house cordoned off, the chest can't have left the grounds. Find it before then, or this will be a diplomatic nightmare!\"",

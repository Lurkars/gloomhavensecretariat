Satha steps up to address the crowd and discusses the successes of the past difficult year. She calls for a moment of silence for those lost to attacks and the elements. Finally, she gives the words everyone's been waiting for: \"Let's eat!\" Honey-cakes, flamefruit tarts, meat pies, and cheese rolls tempt the festival-goers, and several have started on the icewine a bit early. The event moves from speeches to singing, then from laughter to dancing as the sun sets. The revelry continues deep into the night, and the citizenry make it their duty to keep the party going until the last person stumbles home, a smile still glued to their faces. It is a collective sigh of relief from the town of Frosthaven. It may not be hospitable, but it is home.",

You breathe a sigh of relief. And then the attack bells sound. An Algox warband approaches the town at speed, using their natural abilities to bound across the deep snow without slowing. The guards on duty scramble to assume battle positions, but when you glance toward the barracks your spirits sink; the gates are still half-buried. You see the massive doors bulge as the guards within push desperately, trying to swing them open against the piled snow. They're making progress, but you can tell they won't make it to the gate towers in time.",
